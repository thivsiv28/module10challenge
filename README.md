# Object-Oriented Programming: Team Profile Generator

## Description

My task was to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Also had to write a unit test for every part of my code and ensure that it passed each test. The application uses [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) for running the unit tests and [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4) for collecting input from the user. The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```



## Mock-Up

The following image shows a mock-up of the generated HTML’s appearance and functionality:
